    <h1>How Physically Active is the Australian Population?</h1>
    <p>Maintaining good health is essential to living a fulfilling life, and regular physical activity plays a key role in achieving that. 
      Engaging in exercise not only strengthens the body but also enhances mental well-being, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, 
      and improves overall quality of life. Which is why we will be exploring the physical activity levels across Australia, 
      providing insights into how often people in different states and age groups engage in regular exercise. 
      By understanding these trends, we can identify areas for improvement and encourage healthier lifestyles for all Australians.

          <p class="description">In this map, we take a look at the percentage of the population in each of Australia's states
            who exercise more than 3 times a week. This is due to the fact that exercising 3 times a week is a
            general consensus as to the recommended amount to exercise in a week. As we can see, Australian
            Capital Territory (ACT) is the state with the highest participation rate out of the population with 
            67.9%, while Northern Territory (NT) is the lowest with 51.2%. Let's break it down further and see the 
            age groups of the population who actively exercise at least 3 times a week.

            This graph illustrates the participation rates in physical activities across Australian states, broken down by age groups. 
            Each bar represents a state, with different segments indicating the percentage of people in each age group who engage in physical activities. 
            The shades of color correspond to specific age ranges, from 15-17 years old at the top (lightest) to 65+ years old at the bottom (darkest). 
            Notably, states like the Northern Territory (NT) and South Australia (SA) have higher activity rates in younger populations, while other states 
            like New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) show a more balanced distribution of activity across age groups. This data provides insights into 
            how physical activity varies both regionally and across different age demographics in Australia.
